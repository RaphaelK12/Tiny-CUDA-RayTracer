# Tiny-CUDA-RayTracer
This is a small program that demonstrates usage of CUDA to utilize the power of GPU in the algorithm of Whitted ray tracing.

It reaches interactive performance for scenes with almost a million triangles and reflective materials.

# Origin of This Program
This was my work during grad school in a national contest held by NVIDIA in China during the year of 2010, a contest that was for undergraduates, 
grad students and phd candidates to demonstrate their skills of GPU programming.

Eventually, this work stood out and won the first price in the contest.

Below is a photo of Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, presenting me with my trophy.

# Note
- I have no plan of updating this project in the future since this repository is mostly for the purpose of archiving final work of my submission in that contest.
- Since this is my work that was more a decade ago, the tech used in this program doesn't demonstrate the latest available technology.
- Because the contest was held in China, some of the documentation is in Chinese, which was requested by the committee.
